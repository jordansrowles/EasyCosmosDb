# EasyCosmosDb

This is just a little library built from some of the boilerplate code that I use across a few different personal projects.
It's essentially just a little helper library for interfacing with Azure Cosmos Db.

Please see `EasyCosmosDb.Example` for an example of how to use the library.

## Installation
[Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EasyCosmosDb/)
